## 🎨 Introducing the Image Editor - Your Personal Photo Editing Tool! 🖼️

I'm thrilled to share my latest project - an Image Editor built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript! 🚀

With the Image Editor, users can now bring their photos to life by applying a variety of filters such as grayscale, inversion, saturation, and adjusting brightness. Additionally, users have the flexibility to rotate and flip their images to achieve the perfect composition. 🔄✨

One of the standout features of this editor is its ability to dynamically generate CSS code for each applied filter. This not only enhances user experience but also provides a deeper understanding of how CSS filters work under the hood. 💡

## Key Features 

Apply filters: Grayscale, Inversion, Saturation, Brightness, Blur, Contrast, Opacity

Rotate and Flip images for creative freedom

View real-time CSS code for applied filters

Save your edited images effortlessly

Reset all filters with a single click
